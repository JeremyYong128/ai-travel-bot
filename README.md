# Travel chatbot

A simple chatbot that aims to assist users with planning their travelling.

Future enhancements include adding web-scraping tools and further fine-tuning the functionality of the chatbot.

I enjoyed the fact that the code required to set up the bot is minimal, and the integration of AgentOps was smooth. The fact that I can see what the bot does behind the scenes allows me to be assured that I will be able to monitor it well even after I make its function more complex.
